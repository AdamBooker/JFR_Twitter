# Social-Media-Example-Code-JFR

This repository is for code associated with "Social media as a setting for accounting research" by Adam Booker (adam.booker@du.edu), Asher Curtis (abcurtis@uw.edu), and Bin Ke (bizk@nus.edu.sg). The code will be maintained by Adam Booker.

The repository demonstrates how to get social media data using APIs and how to construct a few metrics. Code is presented in Jupiter Notebooks as well as in regular python .py files.

Twitter also has example code here: https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code.
