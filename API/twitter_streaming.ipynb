    "This notebook demonstrates how to connect to and get data from Twitter, Reddit, and Bitly using their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs use Open Authorization (OAuth) to control access to their data. OAuth is a standard that provides a way to delegate internal data access to external parties. This data access method is useful for automated communications and for enforcing efficient query methods (which lowers server costs)."
